# JS: Collaborative tasks

Collaborative tasks for online courses about JS/TS to use with [replit](https://replit.com/) / [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## Reasoning

For quite a long time it was very convinient to use collaborative mode (live sessions) from Codesandbox. However after moving this functionality to paid plan a question about replacing the tool poped up. Both ReplIt and GitPod support import from github, but they do not support importing for projects from repo sub-directories. The purpose for this repo - collect tasks that are used for online lessons to provide suitable way to import them into different dev environments.

## Convention

Whenever you add a new task:

1) create a new branch with self descriptive name (example - `context-custom-bind`)
2) push branch and all related changes to the repo
3) make a PR and in PR description describe details for the task (what is the goal, instructions)
